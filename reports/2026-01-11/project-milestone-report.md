## Introduction

This comprehensive milestone report provides a transparent overview of the Hairline platform development progress across all three tenants: Mobile App (Patient), Provider Dashboard, and Admin Dashboard. As we approach a critical phase in the project lifecycle, it is essential for stakeholders to have a clear understanding of what has been delivered, what remains to be completed, and where additional scope or costs may be required.

This report presents the current status of each tenant through detailed module progress tables, highlighting completed features, work in progress, and pending items. It also identifies any additional work that falls outside the original scope and may incur additional costs, enabling informed business decisions regarding timeline, budget allocation, and feature prioritization for the upcoming MVP release or production launch.

The information contained in this report will support strategic decision-making on resource allocation, scope adjustments, and go-to-market planning.
