## üîÑ Methodology Change & Strategic Approach

### Previous Approach (Phase 1)

We initially attempted to work with the existing codebase, implementing fixes and adding missing screens incrementally. This approach seemed efficient at first, as we believed the gaps were minor.

### Challenge Identified & Current Approach

As we dove deeper into the project, we discovered that **surface-level fixes were creating more problems than they solved**. The codebase inconsistencies were compounding, making the system increasingly difficult to maintain and scale.

**The Core Issue**: As we systematically address each component, we uncover interdependencies that require attention. For example:

- Fixing the inquiry module revealed gaps in the medical questionnaire system
- Updating the quote system exposed payment workflow inconsistencies
- Enhancing aftercare revealed notification service limitations

This cascading nature of issues meant that touching one area would reveal problems in connected areas, requiring us to address them systematically rather than in isolation.

### Strategic Pivot (Phase 2) - Top-Down Systematic Rebuild

We pivoted to a more systematic, sustainable approach:

1. **Requirements First**: Starting from business requirements as the foundation
2. **Module Breakdown**: Systematically breaking down all modules and functional requirements
3. **PRD Rewrite**: Creating comprehensive PRDs ensuring consistency across:
   - UX/UI layouts and user flows
   - Frontend component architecture
   - Backend API endpoint design
   - Database schema and relationships
4. **Parallel Execution**: Working on documentation and implementation simultaneously

While this approach extends timelines, it ensures we're building a **solid, scalable foundation** rather than accumulating technical debt.

### Progress Status

**‚úÖ Completed**:

- System architecture and technical specifications
- PRDs for main modules (Provider, Admin platforms)
- Implementation of documented modules in frontend and backend

**üîÑ In Progress**:

- Core functional requirements documentation (FR-001 to FR-025)
- System-wide consistency improvements
- Final enhancements for Admin platform features

## üë• Resource Management & Task Allocation

### Temporary Task Gaps (2-3 Days Maximum)

**Situation**: Occasionally, team members experience brief periods (2-3 days) where their Plane.so task lists are temporarily empty.

**Root Cause**:

1. **Quality Assurance Process**: I need to thoroughly review completed tasks before they can be marked as done
2. **Requirements Breakdown**: New tasks require detailed breakdown and PRD documentation before assignment
3. **Sequential Dependencies**: Some tasks depend on completed reviews or architectural decisions

**Solution & Assurance**:

- **Rapid Task Replenishment**: We quickly prepare and assign new tasks within 2-3 days maximum
- **Pipeline Management**: Maintaining a backlog of well-defined tasks ready for assignment
- **Optimal Resource Utilization**: These gaps represent less than 5% of working time and occur during transition periods
- **Productive Downtime**: Team members use this time for code review, documentation, and skill development

**Key Point**: Human resources are being utilized suitably and optimally. These brief gaps are natural in a systematic rebuild process and do not impact overall project velocity.
