# Inquiry Submission & Distribution Module - Product Requirements Document

**Module**: P-02: Quote Request & Management | PR-02: Inquiry & Quote Management | A-01: Patient Management & Oversight  
**Feature Branch**: `fr003-inquiry-submission`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Verified & Approved  
**Source**: FR-003 from system-prd.md

## Executive Summary

The Inquiry Submission & Distribution module enables patients to submit comprehensive treatment requests through the mobile app, which are then automatically distributed to relevant providers based on location and availability. The module supports multi-country selection, detailed medical questionnaires, 3D head scanning, and comprehensive inquiry management across all platform tenants.

## Module Scope

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Patient Platform (P-02)**: Quote Request & Management
- **Provider Platform (PR-02)**: Inquiry & Quote Management  
- **Admin Platform (A-01)**: Patient Management & Oversight

### Communication Structure

**Note**: Direct patient-provider chat functionality is currently **not in scope** for V1 and has been moved to the backlog. Communication within the inquiry module is structured through:

- **Patient → System**: Inquiry submission with comprehensive data
- **System → Provider**: Automatic inquiry distribution and notifications
- **Provider → System**: Quote submission and inquiry management
- **Admin → All Parties**: Admin can monitor, edit, and manage all inquiries
- **Structured Updates**: System-generated notifications and status updates

If direct patient-provider chat is implemented in the future, it would be handled through a separate FR (FR-012: Messaging & Communication).

### Entry Points

1. **Patient-Initiated**: Primary flow through mobile app inquiry creation
2. **Admin-Managed**: Direct inquiry creation and management by admin team
3. **Provider-Viewed**: Provider access to distributed inquiries
