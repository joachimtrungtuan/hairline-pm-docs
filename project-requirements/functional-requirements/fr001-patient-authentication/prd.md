# Patient Authentication & Profile Management Module - Product Requirements Document

**Module**: P-01: Auth & Profile Management  
**Feature Branch**: `fr001-patient-authentication`  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Verified & Approved  
**Source**: FR-001 from system-prd.md

## Executive Summary

The Patient Authentication & Profile Management module enables patients to securely register, authenticate, and manage their personal profiles within the Hairline platform. This module serves as the foundation for all patient interactions, providing secure access control, profile management, and account recovery capabilities essential for the medical tourism platform.

## Module Scope

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Patient Platform (P-01)**: Auth & Profile Management
- **Integration Points**: Admin Platform (patient oversight), Provider Platform (anonymized patient data)

### Communication Structure

**Note**: Direct patient-provider communication is currently **not in scope** for V1 and has been moved to the backlog. Authentication and profile management operates through:

- **Patient → System**: Registration, login, profile updates, password management
- **System → Patient**: One-time passcodes (OTP) for email confirmation and password reset, profile update notifications
- **Admin → Patient Data**: Admin can view and manage patient profiles (with audit trail)
- **System → Provider Platform**: Anonymized patient data (no direct communication)

If direct patient-provider communication is implemented in the future, it would be handled through a separate FR (FR-012: Messaging & Communication).

### Entry Points

1. **Patient-Initiated**: Primary flow through mobile app registration and login (patients can ONLY be registered via the mobile app)
2. **Admin-Managed**: Admin can manage patient accounts (view/edit/suspend) but CANNOT create new patient accounts
3. **System-Triggered**: Automatic notifications and confirmations

**Business Rules**:

- Settings content defined elsewhere; back navigation available
- Notification Preferences:
  - Global toggles (MVP): Email, Push
  - Per-category toggles are deferred to V2 (Inquiry, Quote, Booking, Payment, Aftercare, Marketing)
  - Changes are saved immediately; effective within 1 minute
  - Marketing notifications are OFF by default unless explicit consent is stored (applies when V2 categories ship)
  - Failure to save MUST rollback UI to previous values and show actionable error
  - System event triggers (read-only in Settings): user is informed that notifications are sent automatically on stage changes (Inquiry → Quote → Accepted/Confirmed, Payment events, Aftercare reminders)
- Privacy & Security:
  - Change password requires old password and new password meeting policy; on success, existing refresh tokens are revoked
  - 2FA (future): visible as disabled with “coming soon” note
  - Device sessions listing with the ability to revoke a single session or all sessions (requires re-auth)
  - Download my data (GDPR) triggers background export and emails secure link when ready

  - Session-sensitive actions (password change, revoke sessions) require re-auth if > 5 minutes since last re-auth

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

Notifications

1. Given user toggles Push OFF, When saved (immediate), Then push notifications stop within 1 minute.
2. Given a save error occurs, When toggling a global control (Email/Push), Then UI reverts to prior state and displays error message with retry option.
3. Given inquiry stage changes (e.g., Quote received), When Email or Push is ON, Then the user receives a stage update notification according to FR-020.

Privacy & Security
4. Given user submits oldPassword and a new password that meets policy, When request succeeds, Then all previous refresh tokens are revoked and user remains logged in with current session.
5. Given user opens Device sessions, When revoking a session (not current), Then that session is terminated within 1 minute.
6. Given user selects Revoke all sessions, When re-auth succeeds, Then all sessions are terminated except the current one and user is notified.
7. Given user requests Download my data, When request is accepted, Then user sees confirmation and later receives an email with a time-limited secure link.

Data/Validation & Audit
10. Given user changes notification preferences, Then a preference-change audit entry is recorded with who/when/before/after.
11. Given user changes password, Then a security audit entry is recorded and password policy is enforced.
12. Given user revokes sessions, Then audit captures the action and targeted session IDs (masked where appropriate).

**Minimal API/State (Reference)**:

- GET/PUT user profile (firstName, lastName, phone, countryCode, country)
