# Medical Questionnaire Management Module - Product Requirements Document

**Module**: A-09: System Settings & Configuration  
**Feature Branch**: `fr025-medical-questionnaire-management`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Verified & Approved  
**Source**: FR-025 from system-prd.md

## Executive Summary

The Medical Questionnaire Management module enables administrators to centrally manage the comprehensive medical questionnaire used in the inquiry submission process. This module provides complete control over question content, severity flagging, categorization, and version control, ensuring the medical assessment system remains current, compliant, and effective for provider decision-making.

## Module Scope

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Admin Platform (A-09)**: System Settings & Configuration
- **Integration Points**: Patient Platform (inquiry submission), Provider Platform (alert display)

### Communication Structure

- **Admin → System**: Question management and configuration updates
- **System → Patient Platform**: Dynamic questionnaire content delivery
- **System → Provider Platform**: Medical alert generation and display
- **System → All Platforms**: Version-controlled questionnaire updates

### Entry Points

1. **Admin-Initiated**: Primary flow through admin dashboard questionnaire management
2. **System-Triggered**: Automatic questionnaire delivery to patient inquiry process
3. **Provider-Viewed**: Medical alerts generated from questionnaire responses

### Questionnaire Context Types

- The system must support multiple questionnaire context types to distinguish usage across flows:
  - Inquiry: Used during patient inquiry submission
  - Aftercare: Used within aftercare milestone templates
  - Multi-Context: Valid for both Inquiry and Aftercare
- Each questionnaire carries a required Context Type metadata field and optional tags (e.g., "pain", "sleep", "compliance").
- Downstream modules (e.g., Aftercare Template Management) filter selectable questionnaires by compatible Context Type.

## Business Workflows

### Workflow 1: Question Management (Primary Flow)

**Actors**: Admin, System, Questionnaire Engine

**Main Flow**:

1. **Question Creation**
   - Admin accesses questionnaire management dashboard
   - Admin creates new question with content and severity flag
   - System validates question completeness
   - Question added to active questionnaire

2. **Question Editing**
   - Admin selects existing question for modification
   - Admin updates question text, severity, or category
   - System validates changes and maintains version history
   - Updated question replaces previous version

3. **Question Organization**
   - Admin organizes questions into categories (Allergies, Cardiovascular, etc.)
   - Admin reorders questions using drag-and-drop interface
   - System updates question sequence and maintains order
   - Changes reflected in patient questionnaire

4. **Question Activation**
   - Admin reviews complete questionnaire
   - Admin activates updated questionnaire version
   - System deploys new questionnaire to patient platform
   - Previous version archived with timestamp

**Alternative Flows**:

- **A1**: Admin deletes question
  - System performs soft delete (archival)
  - Question removed from active questionnaire
  - Historical responses preserved

- **A2**: Question validation fails
  - System prevents activation
  - Admin notified of validation errors
  - Admin corrects issues before activation

### Workflow 2: Severity Management (Admin Flow)

**Actors**: Admin, System, Alert Engine

**Main Flow**:

1. **Severity Assignment**
   - Admin assigns severity flag to each question
   - Severity options: Critical, Standard, No Alert
   - System validates severity assignment
   - Alert rules updated automatically

2. **Alert Rule Configuration**
   - System generates alert rules based on severity flags
   - Critical questions → Red alerts for providers
   - Standard questions → Yellow/amber alerts for providers
   - No alert questions → Green indicators
   - Admin reviews and confirms alert rules

**Alternative Flows**:

- **B1**: Severity conflict resolution
  - Admin reviews conflicting severity assignments
  - Admin resolves conflicts based on medical guidelines
  - System updates alert generation rules

### Workflow 3: Questionnaire Deployment (System Flow)

**Actors**: System, Patient Platform, Provider Platform

**Main Flow**:

1. **Questionnaire Delivery**
   - System delivers current questionnaire to patient inquiry process
   - Patient platform displays questions with proper formatting
   - System tracks questionnaire version used per inquiry

2. **Response Processing**
   - System processes patient questionnaire responses
   - System applies severity-based alert generation
   - System delivers alerts to provider platform
   - System logs all responses for audit trail

**Alternative Flows**:

- **C1**: Questionnaire version mismatch
  - System detects version inconsistency
  - System updates patient platform with current version
  - Patient re-completes questionnaire if necessary

### Workflow 4: Questionnaire Catalog & Assignment

**Actors**: Admin, System, Aftercare Module

**Main Flow**:

1. Admin creates a new Questionnaire and sets Context Type = Inquiry, Aftercare, or Multi-Context
2. System validates completeness, context assignment, and versioning
3. Questionnaire becomes available in the central catalog with its Context Type
4. In Aftercare Template Management (FR-011 Screen 14), admin selects exactly one Questionnaire Set with Context Type = Aftercare or Multi-Context (single-select)
5. Milestones within the template may schedule questions only from the selected Questionnaire Set
6. System deploys scheduled questionnaires to the aftercare plan according to milestone schedules

**Alternative Flows**:

- **A1**: Context mismatch
  - If a questionnaire with Context Type = Inquiry is selected in an aftercare template, the system blocks selection and explains the mismatch
- **A2**: Context change on active questionnaire
  - Context Type changes create a new version; dependent templates must re-confirm the single selected Questionnaire Set
- **A3**: Questionnaire Set replacement
  - Replacing the selected Questionnaire Set in FR-011 updates all milestone questionnaire references within that template
