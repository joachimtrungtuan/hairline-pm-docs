# Hairline Platform Constitution - Executive Summary

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Ratified**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Active

## Overview

The Hairline Platform Constitution establishes the foundational principles, architecture, and governance for the Hairline medical tourism platform - a comprehensive system connecting patients seeking hair transplant procedures with vetted clinics worldwide.

## System Architecture

### Three Main Tenants

1. **Patient Platform (Mobile App)**
   - iOS/Android mobile application
   - Core features: Quote requests, booking, payment, travel logistics, aftercare monitoring
   - Technology: React Native/Flutter OR Native (Swift/Kotlin)

2. **Provider Platform (Web)**
   - Clinic/hospital management web application
   - Core features: Inquiry management, quote submission, appointment scheduling, treatment execution
   - Technology: React/Vue.js frontend + Laravel backend

3. **Admin Platform (Web)**
   - Internal operations and oversight web application
   - Core features: Patient/provider management, billing, aftercare oversight, system configuration
   - Technology: React/Vue.js frontend + Laravel backend

**Additional**: Affiliate Platform (lightweight sub-module for influencer partnerships)

## Core Principles (10 Non-Negotiable + Essential)

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Three independent tenants with strict API-only communication
- No direct database access across tenants
- Independent deployment capability

### 2. Medical Data Privacy & Security (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Healthcare-grade security (GDPR, HIPAA-equivalent)
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- 7-year minimum data retention
- Audit trails for all data access
- Provider anonymization until payment

### 3. API-First Design

- Backend APIs before frontend UI
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation mandatory
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- 3-month deprecation period for breaking changes

### 4. User Experience & Accessibility

- Mobile-first design
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- Multi-language support (i18n)
- < 3 second load times (p95)
- Offline capability for core features

### 5. Testing Discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Multi-level testing: unit, integration, contract, E2E, security, performance
- TDD for security-critical features (auth, payment)
- 90%+ coverage for critical flows

### 6. Data Integrity & Audit Trail (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- All state changes auditable
- Immutable financial transactions
- **HARD DELETES STRICTLY PROHIBITED**: System MUST NOT allow hard deletion of any medical, financial, or patient data
- Soft-deletes ONLY for all critical entities (7-year minimum retention for healthcare/tax compliance)
- Archived data MUST remain accessible for compliance audits
- Versioned treatment packages and pricing

### 7. Modularity & Independent Deployment

- System broken into independent modules per tenant
- Shared services as microservices (3D scan processing, payments, notifications)
- Clear module boundaries and interfaces

### 8. Performance & Scalability

- API response: p95 < 500ms, p99 < 1000ms
- Support 10,000+ concurrent patients, 1,000+ providers
- CDN for static assets, job queues for background tasks

### 9. Internationalization & Localization

- Multi-currency support with real-time exchange rates
- Multiple language support (English, Turkish initially)
- Timezone-aware date/time handling
- Country-specific provider listings

### 10. Versioning & Change Management

- Semantic versioning across all components
- Backward compatibility requirements
- 2 major versions supported during deprecation
- Tagged releases with changelogs

## Documentation Organization

**IMPORTANT**: All project documentation generated based on this Constitution MUST be placed in:

```markdown
local-docs/project-requirements/
```

### Current Structure (System-Level Documentation)

```

### Future Structure (Module-Level Documentation)

When breaking down the system into independent modules, the structure will evolve to:

```markdown
local-docs/project-requirements/
├── [system-level docs as above]
├── system-design/              # High-level system design (flows & design phase)
│   ├── architecture/           # System architecture & deployment diagrams
│   ├── data-models/            # Database schemas, ERDs, entity definitions
│   └── user-flows/             # User journey maps, wireframes, UX specs
├── api-specs/                  # Shared API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger)
├── security/                   # Security assessments, compliance, audit reports
└── modules/                    # Each module's complete documentation
    ├── patient-auth/           # Example module
    │   ├── prd.md              # Product Requirements Document
    │   ├── technical-spec.md   # Detailed technical specifications
    │   ├── api-contracts.md    # Module-specific API contracts
    │   └── testing-plan.md     # Test cases and coverage plans
    ├── patient-quotes/
    ├── provider-inquiries/
    └── [module-name]/          # Repeat for each module
```

**Key Principles**:

- **System-level first**: Start with comprehensive system documentation before breaking into modules
- **Update logs**: All documentation changes tracked in `update-logs/` for audit trail
- **Module folders**: Each module contains ALL its documentation in one place (when created)
- **Shared resources**: API specs and security docs centralized for cross-module reference

This structure scales cleanly as modules are added while maintaining system-level coherence.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Constitution ratified and documented
2. Create Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for each major module
3. Develop architecture diagrams (system, data, deployment)
4. Design database schema and ERD
5. Define API contract specifications (OpenAPI specs)
6. Finalize technology stack and project scaffolding
7. Begin Phase 1 (MVP) development

## Success Metrics

- **Adherence**: 95%+ Constitution compliance in code reviews
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities in production
- **Performance**: 95% of API calls under 500ms
- **Quality**: 80%+ test coverage across codebase
- **Delivery**: Independent module deployment every 2-week sprint
- **User Satisfaction**: < 3 second load times, < 3 clicks for critical flows
