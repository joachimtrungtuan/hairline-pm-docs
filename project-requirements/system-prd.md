### FR-024: Treatment & Package Management

**Priority**: P1 (MVP)  
**Module(s)**: A-09: System Settings & Configuration | PR-06: Profile & Settings Management

---

#### Part A: Treatments (Admin-Created Foundation)

**Requirements**:

- **Treatment Creation Authority**: ONLY admin can create treatments
- Treatments are the **foundation** that all providers select from (ensures consistency)
- Admin creates treatments with: name, description, type (FUE, FUT, DHI), video, images, technique details
- Providers can ONLY select from pre-created treatment list (cannot create custom treatments)
- Providers configure **pricing** for each treatment in their clinic
- All providers see the **same treatment list** (FUE, FUT, DHI, etc.)

**Examples of Treatments**:

- FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction)
- FUT (Follicular Unit Transplantation)
- DHI (Direct Hair Implantation)
- Sapphire FUE
- Robotic Hair Transplant

---

#### Part B: Packages (Provider-Created Add-Ons)

**Requirements**:

- **Package Creation Authority**: Each provider creates their own packages
- Packages are **optional add-ons** that supplement the treatment
- Providers configure: package name, description, pricing, availability
- Each provider has **their own package list** (can differ between providers)
- Packages are NOT part of treatment - they are separate selections

**Examples of Packages**:

- Hotel packages (3-star, 4-star, 5-star)
- Transport packages (airport pickup, city transfers)
- Flight assistance packages
- Medication packages (post-op medications to take home)
- PRP therapy add-on
- Extended consultation packages

---

#### Quote Structure

```sh
Quote = Treatment (required) + Packages (optional)
      = Treatment Price + Package Prices = Total Quote
```

**Example Quote Breakdown**:

```sh
Treatment: FUE (3000 grafts)           £2,500
Package: 4-star hotel (5 nights)       £300
Package: Airport transfer              £50
Package: PRP therapy session           £150
                                       ------
Total Quote:                           £3,000
```

---

#### Rationale

**Why Separate Treatments and Packages?**

1. **Consistency**: All providers offer same treatments (FUE, FUT, DHI) with standardized info and videos
2. **Flexibility**: Providers differentiate through their own package offerings
3. **Scalability**: When platform offers direct travel booking, provider packages can be disabled without affecting treatments
4. **Clarity**: Patients understand core procedure vs optional add-ons
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy transition from provider-managed to platform-managed services

- **Alert System**: When patient answers "Yes" to Standard questions → inquiry flagged with yellow/amber alerts  
- **Alert System**: When patient answers "No" to all questions → inquiry flagged with green (no alerts)
- **Question Grouping**: Admin MUST be able to organize questions into categories (Allergies, Cardiovascular, etc.)

**Requirements**:

- Settings Management UI (Admin)
  - Admins MUST be able to view, create, update, and version settings within clearly defined groups:
    - Authentication & Security
    - App Data (Lists)
    - Notifications
  - All changes MUST require a reason and be fully audited (who/when/old value/new value)

- Authentication & Security (affects P-01 and others)
  - Password policy is FIXED in codebase (not editable in Admin): min length ≥ 12 and must include upper, lower, digit, special from !@#$%^&(),.?":{}|<>
  - Authentication throttling MUST be configurable: max login attempts before lockout and lockout duration
  - OTP configuration: length is FIXED at 6 in codebase; expiry (default 15 min) and resend cooldown/rate limits MUST be configurable
  - System MUST support IP/device-level rate limiting for anti–brute force protections

- App Data (Centrally Managed Lists)
  - Discovery question options ("How did you find out about us?") MUST be centrally managed
  - Country list and country calling codes MUST be centrally managed
  - Changes MUST propagate to dependent UIs within 1 minute

- Notifications
  - Templates for OTP delivery (verification/reset) MUST be editable with variables and preview
  - Changes MUST NOT affect delivery to users already in a flow

**Data Security & Governance**:

- All setting changes MUST be versioned and auditable; hard deletes are PROHIBITED (archive only)
- System MUST support rollback to any previous version for a given setting group
- Access MUST be restricted to authorized admin roles; sensitive values must be masked in UI and logs

**Impacted Modules**:

- P-01: Auth & Profile (password policy, OTP, throttling, countries/calling codes, discovery options)
- PR-06: Provider Settings (indirect consumption of lists)
- S-03: Notification Service (OTP templates)

**Success Criteria**:

- 100% of changes to settings captured with who/when/what-before/after
- Setting changes propagate to dependent services within ≤ 1 minute
- Zero production incidents linked to settings drift after enabling versioning and rollback
- Security scanning shows no exposure of sensitive setting values in UI or logs
