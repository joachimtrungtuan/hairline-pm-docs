## FR-011: Aftercare & Recovery Management

- Screen 14 (Milestone Template Management): Clarified questionnaire ownership and selection from FR-025 catalog.
- Screen 14: Enforced single-select Questionnaire Set per aftercare template. All milestones schedule questions only from the selected set; replacing the set updates all milestones.
- Screens 15â€“16: Marked as Backlog (post-MVP analytics) with rationale.

## FR-025: Medical Questionnaire Management

- Added "Questionnaire Context Types" (Inquiry, Aftercare, Multi-Context) with downstream filtering.
- Added Workflow 4 (Catalog & Assignment) to define creation with context type and single-select assignment into FR-011 templates; added replacement behavior and mismatch blocking.
- Screen 1/2: Added Context Type fields and filters; clarified downstream filtering by Context Type.
- Integration Rules: Added FR-011 integration specifying single-select Questionnaire Set and scheduling constraints.

## Rationale

- Aligns with client guidance to keep analytics as a later phase and to ensure aftercare setups reference exactly one questionnaire set, while centralizing questionnaire authoring/versioning in FR-025.

## Impact

- FR-011 template setup UX: single-select questionnaire set; simpler scheduling per milestone.
- FR-025 catalog: must label questionnaires with correct Context Type; prevents incorrect attachments.
