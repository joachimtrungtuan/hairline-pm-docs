# FR-007 PRD Verification - November 12, 2025

Status: ✅ Verified & Approved

Scope: Finalize FR-007 Payment Processing PRD, verify alignment with `system-prd.md`, cross-check client transcription requirements, and synchronize change history.

## Changes

- Set PRD status to "✅ Verified & Approved" following full cross-check.
- Added change-log entry (v1.5) documenting verification and cross-references.
- Ensured appendices (approvals, last updated) reflect November 12, 2025.
- Simplified admin configuration notes to link directly to `FR-029: Payment System Configuration`.
- Confirmed multi-tenant responsibilities, workflows, and screen specs against transcripts.

## Consistency

- Requirements match `system-prd.md` FR-007 scope (multi-currency payments, deposits, refunds, commissions, payouts).
- Patient, provider, and admin responsibilities verified against Hairline app/provider/admin transcripts.
- Configuration and payout ownership delegated to FR-029 and FR-017 respectively.
- Business rules reflect FR-006 cancellation policy and FR-007B installment guidance.

## Impact

- FR-007 is implementation-ready with traceable dependencies and configuration references.
- Reduces duplication by centralizing configuration links to FR-029.
- Provides clear audit trail for verification activities on November 12, 2025.
