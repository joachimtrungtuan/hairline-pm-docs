### TREATMENT_PACKAGE_CLARIFICATION_2025-10-23.md

**Critical clarification** of Treatments vs Packages architecture.

**Contents**:

- **Treatments**: Admin-created foundation (FUE, FUT, DHI) - ensures consistency across all providers
- **Packages**: Provider-created add-ons (hotels, transport, medications) - allows differentiation
- Updated data schema: `treatments` table (admin-created), `packages` table (provider-created)
- Updated FR-024 with clear separation and examples
- Database migration required (`packages` table schema change)

### REQUIREMENTS_VERIFICATION_2025-10-23.md

**Comprehensive verification** of documentation against original transcriptions.

**Contents**:

- **5 Critical Issues Identified**:
  1. ⚠️ **UNCLEAR**: Patient-provider chat/negotiation (transcription shows uncertainty)
  2. ❌ **OUT OF SCOPE**: Provider self-onboarding (admin adds providers, not provider-initiated)
  3. ❌ **NOT MENTIONED**: Escrow account management (needs clarification)
  4. ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE**: FR-011 Aftercare missing 6 critical requirements
     - Aftercare template selection
     - 3D scans during aftercare (milestone-based)
     - Questionnaires during aftercare (pain, sleep, compliance)
     - Standalone aftercare service (Hairline-provided, separate from treatment)
     - Admin assigns provider for standalone aftercare (needs clarification)
  5. **MISSING**: Instructions and medications setup in aftercare process
- Recommendations for stakeholder clarification
- Required documentation updates
