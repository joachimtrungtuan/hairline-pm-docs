# FR-001 PRD Verification - October 30, 2025

Status: âœ… Verified & Approved

Scope: Finalize FR-001 Patient Authentication & Profile Management PRD and align references.

## Changes

- Set PRD status to "Verified & Approved".
- Screen 14 (Profile Overview): finalized delete-account soft-delete, re-auth, blockers, previous treatments (Completed-only), reviews eligibility.
- Screen 16 (Settings): MVP global notification toggles only; category toggles deferred to V2; optimistic UI + rollback; security actions require re-auth; device sessions revoke; GDPR export.
- Minimal API/State added for PRD-level clarity.

## Consistency

- Matches `system-prd.md` constraints (fixed password policy, fixed 6-digit OTP, centrally managed datasets).
- Aligned with constitution and A-09 governance for configurable throttling and OTP expiry/cooldown.

## Impact

- Clear MVP scope for notifications.
- Security posture reinforced with re-auth and token revocation rules.
