# FR-025 Medical Questionnaire Management PRD Creation

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Type**: New Functional Requirement PRD  
**Scope**: FR-025 Medical Questionnaire Management  
**Status**: ✅ Verified & Approved

---

## Summary

Created comprehensive PRD for FR-025 (Medical Questionnaire Management) following constitution standards. This module enables centralized management of medical questionnaire content with dynamic alert generation for the inquiry process.

---

## Background

### Why FR-025 Was Needed

During FR-003 (Inquiry Submission) development, it became clear that:

1. **Hard-coded questionnaires** were not scalable
2. **Centralized management** was required for consistency
3. **Dynamic alert generation** needed admin control
4. **Version control** was essential for compliance

### Client Requirements Source

Based on transcription analysis:

- Medical questionnaire alerts are for **provider awareness**, not patient rejection
- 3-tier alert system: Critical (red), Standard (yellow), No Alert (green)
- Admin must control question content and severity flags
- Integration with FR-003 inquiry process required

---

## PRD Creation Process

### 1. Constitution Compliance

✅ **10-Section Structure**: Followed mandatory PRD structure  
✅ **Module Mapping**: A-09: System Settings & Configuration  
✅ **Quality Standards**: Met all 8 quality requirements  
✅ **Template Reference**: Used FR-011 as definitive template  

### 2. Content Development

#### Business Workflows

- **Workflow 1**: Admin Questionnaire Management (main + 3 alternative flows)
- **Workflow 2**: Questionnaire Integration (system flow)

#### Screen Specifications (Admin Platform)

- **Screen 1**: Questionnaire Management Dashboard
- **Screen 2**: Question Editor
- **Screen 3**: Category Management
- **Screen 4**: Questionnaire Preview
- **Screen 5**: Version History & Audit Trail

#### Business Rules

- Centralized question management
- Severity-based alert generation
- Version control and audit trail
- Integration with FR-003 inquiry process

### 3. User Feedback Integration

#### Initial Approval

- ✅ Core functionality approved
- ✅ Workflow structure confirmed
- ✅ Screen specifications validated
- ✅ Business rules accepted

#### Modification Request

- **Bulk Import Removal**: User requested removal of bulk import functionality
- **Rationale**: Reduces development complexity
- **Action**: Removed from Screen 1 and business rules

#### Final Approval

- ✅ Status updated to "Verified & Approved"
- ✅ All requirements confirmed
- ✅ Ready for technical specification

## Technical Integration

### Dependencies

- **FR-003**: Inquiry Submission & Distribution (questionnaire delivery)
- **FR-002**: Medical History & 3D Scanning (medical data integration)
- **FR-020**: Notifications & Alerts (provider alert delivery)
- **FR-001**: Patient Authentication & Profile Management (admin access)

### Data Flow

1. **Admin** creates/edits questions with severity flags
2. **System** delivers questionnaire to patients during inquiry
3. **Patient** answers questions (Yes/No)
4. **System** generates alerts based on severity flags
5. **Provider** sees color-coded alerts in inquiry view

## Quality Assurance

### Verification Process

✅ **Constitution Compliance**: All mandatory sections present  
✅ **Content Quality**: No implementation details, focused on business needs  
✅ **Requirement Completeness**: All requirements testable and unambiguous  
✅ **Feature Readiness**: All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria  
✅ **Stakeholder Approval**: User confirmed and approved with minor modification  

### Checklist Results

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

- **Dynamic Rendering**: Questions must be rendered dynamically from admin configuration
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs for question management and delivery
- **Integration Points**: Seamless integration with FR-003 inquiry process
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple languages and question categories
- **Security**: Admin access control and audit trail requirements

### Development Priority

- **Priority**: P1 (MVP)
- **Dependencies**: Must be completed before FR-003 implementation
- **Timeline**: Estimated 2-3 weeks development time

## Files Created

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `fr025-medical-questionnaire-management/prd.md` | Main PRD document | ✅ Verified & Approved |
| `fr025-medical-questionnaire-management/checklists/requirements.md` | Quality checklist | ✅ Removed (redundant) |

## Cross-Reference Updates

### System PRD Updates

- ✅ Added FR-025 section to `system-prd.md`
- ✅ Updated total FR count from 24 to 25
- ✅ Corrected FR order (moved FR-024 and FR-025 to correct positions)

### Constitution Updates

- ✅ Updated folder structure references
- ✅ Maintained template reference to FR-011

### README Updates

- ✅ Updated FR count to 25
- ✅ Maintained consistency with other documents

## Decision Log

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Bulk Import Removal**: Removed to reduce development complexity
2. **Severity Flag System**: 3-tier system (Critical/Standard/No Alert)
3. **Integration Approach**: Direct integration with FR-003 inquiry process
4. **Admin-Only Management**: No provider access to question management
5. **Version Control**: Full audit trail for compliance requirements

### Rationale

- **Simplicity**: Focus on core functionality first
- **Consistency**: Align with existing alert system
- **Efficiency**: Direct integration reduces complexity
- **Security**: Admin-only access ensures data integrity
- **Compliance**: Audit trail meets healthcare requirements

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Design API contracts for question management
- [ ] Plan integration with FR-003 inquiry process

### Future

- [ ] Implement question management interface
- [ ] Develop dynamic questionnaire rendering
