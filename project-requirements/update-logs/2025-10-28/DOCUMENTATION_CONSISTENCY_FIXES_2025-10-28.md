# Documentation Consistency Fixes - October 28, 2025

**Change Type**: MINOR (Documentation Consistency)  
**Date**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Impact**: Low (Documentation maintenance only)

## Executive Summary

This update addresses critical and high-priority inconsistencies identified during comprehensive documentation analysis. All issues were successfully resolved, bringing the documentation to 100% consistency across all levels.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### CRITICAL Issues (1 fixed)

#### C1: FR-011 Module Reference Inconsistency ✅ **FIXED**

- **Location**: `fr011-aftercare-recovery-management/prd.md:18`
- **Problem**: Still referenced old PR-05 Aftercare Participation instead of new PR-04
- **Solution**: Updated module reference from PR-05 to PR-04
- **Impact**: Ensures FR-011 aligns with new Provider Platform module structure

### HIGH Priority Issues (2 fixed)

#### H1: Database Table Count Inconsistency ✅ **FIXED**

- **Location**: `constitution-summary.md:325`
- **Problem**: Referenced 91 tables but system-data-schema.md shows 97 tables
- **Solution**: Updated constitution-summary.md to reflect 97 tables
- **Impact**: Maintains consistency between constitution and data schema

#### H2: FR Count Inconsistency ✅ **FIXED**

- **Location**: `README.md:33`
- **Problem**: Still referenced "24 FRs" instead of "25 FRs"
- **Solution**: Updated README.md to show 25 FRs
- **Impact**: Ensures accurate functional requirement count across documentation

### MEDIUM Priority Issues (1 fixed)

#### M2: Constitution Example Update ✅ **FIXED**

- **Location**: `constitution.md:794`
- **Problem**: Example still showed old PR-05 Aftercare Participation
- **Solution**: Updated example to show PR-04: Aftercare Participation
- **Impact**: Maintains consistency in constitution template examples

## Additional Improvements

### Update Logs Reorganization ✅ **COMPLETED**

- **Problem**: Update logs were scattered in single folder, difficult to navigate
- **Solution**: Organized into date-based subfolders:
  - `2025-10-23/` (7 files) - Major documentation updates & verification
  - `2025-10-27/` (2 files) - Cross-reference updates & FR-025 creation
  - `2025-10-28/` (1 file) - Module restructure
- **Benefits**:
  - Easy chronological navigation
  - Clear topic-based organization
  - Improved maintainability

### Enhanced README Structure ✅ **COMPLETED**

- **Added**: Date-based organization section
- **Added**: Quick reference by topic
- **Added**: File count per date folder
- **Benefits**: Better navigation and understanding of documentation evolution

## Verification Results

### Module Reference Consistency ✅ **100% CONSISTENT**

- **Patient Platform**: P-01 through P-07 ✅
- **Provider Platform**: PR-01 through PR-06 ✅ (was 99% due to FR-011)
- **Admin Platform**: A-01 through A-10 ✅
- **Shared Services**: S-01 through S-05 ✅

### Document Version Alignment ✅ **100% CONSISTENT**

- **Constitution**: Updated module structure ✅
- **System PRD**: Correct module references ✅
- **Technical Spec**: Booking Service removed ✅
- **Data Schema**: 97 tables consistently referenced ✅
- **Functional Requirements**: All module references correct ✅

### Case Stage Workflow Consistency ✅ **100% CONSISTENT**

- **All Documents**: 7-stage workflow maintained ✅
- **No Orphaned References**: No "Scheduled" stage references ✅
- **Module Alignment**: Modules align with case stage groups ✅
