# Workflow Correction - October 23, 2025

## Change Summary

**Type**: Workflow Correction  
**Impact**: Medium (documentation only - corrects misinterpretation)  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Corrected **Workflow 2: Provider Quote Management** in the system-prd.md to accurately reflect the client's original requirements. Removed the incorrect "assign inquiry to surgeon for assessment" step which was not mentioned in the source transcriptions.

---

## What Was Incorrect

### Previous Workflow (Incorrect)

```sh
1. Inquiry Receipt
   - Reviews patient details
   - Assigns inquiry to surgeon for assessment  ❌

2. Assessment  ❌
   - Surgeon reviews scan
   - Determines candidacy
   - Estimates graft count

3. Quote Creation
   - Selects treatment
   - Sets pricing
   ...
```

**Problem**: The transcriptions never mention "assigning to surgeon" as a separate step. This was an assumption added during documentation.

---

## What Is Correct (Per Transcriptions)

### Corrected Workflow

```sh
1. Inquiry Receipt
   - Reviews patient details, 3D scan, medical history
   - Reviews medical questionnaire with color-coded alerts ✅

2. Quote Creation
   - Selects treatment package template
   - Analyzes 3D scan to estimate graft count
   - Selects clinician who will perform procedure ✅
   - Sets pricing
   - Pre-schedules appointment times
   - Adds notes
   ...

3. Quote Submission
4. Negotiation (Optional)
5. Quote Acceptance
6. Pre-Procedure Preparation
```

---

## Source Evidence

From **Hairline-ProviderPlatformPart1.txt** (lines 10-49):

> "But the idea is once the patient has submitted a request for a quote, they will get this inquiry tab, they will have the patient, age, problem, la, la, la. And they'll be able to click on it and have the information that the patient submitted."
> "And then once, you know, so they can click on submit code [quote], when they click on submit code [quote], they'll have, you know, this category of different information."

**Key Quote (lines 135-137)**:

> "So, then they'll **add the clinician**. So, which clinician is doing the procedure, they'll **select from the clinicians**"

**Finding**: The provider reviews the inquiry themselves and selects the clinician DURING quote creation, not as a separate assignment step.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed "Assessment" Stage

- ❌ Deleted separate "Assessment" step
- ❌ Removed "Assigns inquiry to surgeon" sub-step
- ✅ Provider reviews inquiry directly

### 2. Updated "Quote Creation" Stage

- ✅ Added: "Analyzes 3D scan to estimate graft count needed"
- ✅ Added: "**Selects clinician** who will perform the procedure (from clinic's staff list)"
- ✅ Added: "Adds photos/videos of similar cases or visual treatment plan"
- ✅ Added: "Adds notes for patient"

### 3. Renumbered Workflow Steps

```sh
Old → New
1 → 1 (Inquiry Receipt)
2 → [Removed] (Assessment)
3 → 2 (Quote Creation)
4 → 3 (Quote Submission)
5 → 4 (Negotiation)
6 → 5 (Quote Acceptance)
7 → 6 (Pre-Procedure Preparation)
```

## Workflow Now Matches Reality

### Provider's Actual Process

1. **Receives inquiry** → Reviews patient info, scan, medical history
2. **Creates quote** → Selects treatment, estimates grafts, selects clinician, sets pricing
3. **Submits quote** → Patient receives quote
4. **Optional chat** → Answers patient questions
5. **Gets notification** → Quote accepted, appointment auto-confirmed
6. **Prepares** → Sends pre-op instructions

**No separate "assignment to surgeon" step exists**.

---

## Why This Matters

1. **Implementation Impact**: Developers don't need to build a separate "assignment" workflow
2. **UI Simplification**: Provider interface doesn't need assignment screens
3. **Workflow Efficiency**: Providers can directly create quotes without extra steps
4. **Accurate Requirements**: Documentation now matches client's actual vision

## Files Updated

### system-prd.md

**Section**: Workflow 2: Provider Quote Management

**Changes**:

- Removed Stage 2: "Assessment"
- Removed sub-step: "Assigns inquiry to surgeon for assessment"
- Updated Stage 2 (was 3): "Quote Creation"
  - Added: Analyzes 3D scan to estimate graft count
  - Added: Selects clinician who will perform procedure
  - Added: Adds photos/videos or visual treatment plan
  - Added: Adds notes for patient
- Renumbered all subsequent stages (3-6)

---

## Impact Assessment

### Database

- ❌ No changes needed
- The `quotes` table doesn't need an "assigned_surgeon_id" field
- Clinician selection stored in quote metadata

### API

- ❌ No "assign inquiry" endpoint needed
- ✅ Existing quote creation endpoint already supports clinician selection

### UI/UX

- ✅ Simpler provider workflow
- ❌ No "assign to surgeon" screen needed
- ✅ Clinician dropdown in quote creation form (already planned)

### Business Logic

- ✅ Matches how clinics actually operate
- ✅ Faster quote turnaround (no extra assignment step)
- ✅ Clear responsibility (provider who creates quote owns it)

---

## Lessons Learned

### Documentation Process

1. **Always verify assumptions** against source transcriptions
2. **Don't add steps** that "make sense" but weren't requested
3. **Keep workflows simple** unless complexity is explicitly required
4. **User requested review** caught this - encourage such reviews!

### Going Forward

- Cross-reference all workflows against transcriptions
- Flag any "logical additions" for client confirmation
- Maintain audit trail of corrections
